Plan:
1) Plan the layout of each "site" of the framework
-MAIN PAGE (dataset assembler): the user can assemble their own datasets and will be able to choose a
sorting algorithm, the result of the sort will be shown here.

-import/export page: There will be options
to import datasets from files and to save and export the animations created by the program.

-tutorial page: The user will be able to see a quick 'how to video' which explains the software in details.
